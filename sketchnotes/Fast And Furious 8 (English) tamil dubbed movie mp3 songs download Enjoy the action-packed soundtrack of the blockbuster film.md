The movie begins with Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) enjoying their honeymoon in Cuba, where Dom is challenged by his cousin's debtor to a street race. Dom wins the race by using a rundown car that he modifies with Cuban NOS. He then gives his cousin the car he won and drives away in his own car, which explodes due to the NOS. He is then approached by a mysterious woman named Cipher (Theron), who shows him something on her phone that convinces him to work for her.
 
Meanwhile, Luke Hobbs (Johnson) is recruited by Mr. Nobody (Russell) to retrieve an EMP device from a military outpost in Berlin. He enlists the help of Dom and his team: Letty, Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej Parker (Bridges) and Ramsey (Emmanuel). They successfully steal the device, but Dom betrays them and drives away with it, while Cipher remotely disables their vehicles. Hobbs is captured by the German authorities and sent to prison, where he encounters his former enemy Deckard Shaw (Statham), who reveals that he was framed by Cipher for killing Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang).
 
Mr. Nobody and his protÃ©gÃ© Little Nobody (Eastwood) rescue Hobbs and Shaw and recruit them to stop Cipher and Dom. They also bring along Owen Shaw (Evans), Deckard's younger brother and former leader of a mercenary team that clashed with Dom's crew in London. They track down Dom's location in New York City, where Cipher hacks into hundreds of cars and uses them as weapons to cause chaos and distract the authorities. She then orders Dom to steal a nuclear football from the Russian Minister of Defense's limousine. Dom succeeds, but is confronted by his team, who try to persuade him to come back. Letty catches up with him and tries to take the football from him, but he escapes with Cipher's henchman Rhodes (Hivju), who shoots her car and leaves her behind.
