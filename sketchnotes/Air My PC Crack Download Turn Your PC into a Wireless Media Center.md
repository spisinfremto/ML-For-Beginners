# How to Play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Multiplayer on PC in 2022
 
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the first game in the Assassin's Creed franchise to feature multiplayer, which allows players to compete against each other in various modes and maps. However, the online services for the game on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 were shut down by Ubisoft in September 2022[^4^], making it impossible to play multiplayer through the official servers.
 
Fortunately, there is still a way to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood multiplayer on PC in 2022, thanks to a fan-made project called ACBMP. ACBMP is a mod that replaces the original multiplayer launcher with a custom one that connects to a private server hosted by the ACBMP team. This allows players to join and create matches, chat with other players, and access all the multiplayer features of the game.

To play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood multiplayer on PC in 2022 using ACBMP, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on your PC. You can use any version of the game, whether it's from Steam, Uplay, or a cracked copy. However, you need to make sure that your game is updated to version 1.03, which is the latest patch for the game. You can download the patch from here[^1^].
2. Download and install ACBMP from here[^2^]. This is the mod that will allow you to play multiplayer on a private server. You need to extract the files from the zip archive and copy them to your game folder, overwriting any existing files.
3. Run ACBMP.exe from your game folder. This will launch the custom multiplayer launcher that will connect you to the ACBMP server. You need to create an account and log in with your username and password.
4. Enjoy playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood multiplayer on PC in 2022! You can join or create matches from the lobby screen, chat with other players, customize your profile and characters, and earn achievements and rewards.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood multiplayer offers a unique and thrilling experience that differs from the single-player mode. In multiplayer, you can choose from a variety of characters, each with their own appearance, weapons, and abilities. You can also customize your character with different outfits, colors, and perks.
 
The multiplayer modes in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood are divided into two categories: Wanted and Alliance. In Wanted, you are assigned a target to kill while avoiding being killed by your pursuers. In Alliance, you team up with another player and work together to eliminate your enemies. Each mode has different rules and objectives that require strategy and stealth.
